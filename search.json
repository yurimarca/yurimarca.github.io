    "text": "In the dynamic world of short-term property rentals, accurately predicting rental prices is crucial for maximizing occupancy and revenue. To address this challenge, I developed a comprehensive, reproducible Machine Learning (ML) pipeline tailored for short-term rental price prediction in New York City (NYC). This project emphasizes modularity, scalability, and ease of retraining to accommodate the ever-evolving rental market.\n\n\nThe primary goal of this project is to construct an end-to-end ML pipeline capable of:\n\nData Ingestion: Collecting and storing raw rental data.\nData Cleaning: Processing the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights into data distributions and relationships.\nData Validation: Ensuring data quality and integrity.\nData Splitting: Partitioning data into training, validation, and test sets.\nModel Training: Building a predictive model using algorithms like Random Forest.\nHyperparameter Optimization: Fine-tuning model parameters for optimal performance.\nModel Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy and generalization capabilities.\nDeployment: Preparing the model for production use.\n\n\n\n\nThe project is organized as follows:\n.\n├── components/                  # Reusable pipeline components\n│   ├── get_data/                # Data ingestion module\n│   ├── test_regression_model/   # Model testing module\n│   └── train_val_test_split/    # Data splitting module\n├── src/                         # Source code for main pipeline steps\n│   ├── basic_cleaning/          # Data cleaning scripts\n│   ├── data_check/              # Data validation scripts\n│   ├── eda/                     # Exploratory Data Analysis scripts\n│   └── train_random_forest/     # Model training scripts\n├── images/                      # Visual assets for documentation\n├── .github/workflows/           # GitHub Actions for CI/CD\n├── cookie-mlflow-step/          # Template for creating new pipeline steps\n├── conda.yml                    # Conda environment configuration\n├── config.yaml                  # Pipeline configuration settings\n├── environment.yml              # Alternative environment configuration\n├── main.py                      # Main script to run the pipeline\n├── MLproject                    # MLflow project specification\n└── README.md                    # Project documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nThis module handles the retrieval of raw data, ensuring it’s stored in a structured format suitable for downstream processing.
