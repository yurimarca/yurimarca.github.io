## SUMMARY

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile-pic.png">

I'm a Master student in Electronic and Information Engineering at Shinshu University, Japan. I earned my B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Federal University of Technology – Paraná (UTFPR), Brazil in 2016. During my graduation, I studied one year at Concordia University, Canada as an exchange student participant of the program Science Without Borders. My research interests include evolutionary computation, multi- and many-objectives optimization, deep learning.
